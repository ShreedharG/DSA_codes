Dynamic Programming can be described as storing answers to various sub-problems to be used later whenever required to solve the main problem.

The two common dynamic programming approaches are:
- `Memoization`: Known as the “top-down” dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of the main problem to the base cases.
- `Tabulation`: Known as the “bottom-up” dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of solving the base cases to the main problem.
