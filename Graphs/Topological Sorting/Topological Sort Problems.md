Another pillar of graph algorithms concepts is the topological sort concepts. These are used only in *Directed Acyclic Graphs(DAG)*. 
These are used where task (represented as nodes) are to be executed in an hierarchy. Our aim is therefore is to to sort the nodes from pre-requisites/dependencies to the higher level. Used extensively in problems of *task scheduling* where certain tasks are to be executed only after defined dependencies.
