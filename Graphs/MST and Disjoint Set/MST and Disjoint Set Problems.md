`Spanning Tree` : Graph having V vertices connected by E edges where E = V-1 and connecting each vertex once. Can be weighted/unweighted graph.
`Minimum Spanning Tree` : Spanning trees can be of several combinations. The tree having minimum sum of all weights in a spanning tree is the MST.
`Disjoint Set Union` : Also called **Union Find**, it is a data structure used to keep track of set of elements that are partitioned into disjoint subsets. 
- `find(x)` Returns parent node of node x
- `union_(x,y)` Merges the set containing *x* and *y*.
Executed in ~O(1) time complexity.
