Non-linear data structure that we’ve seen so far is Tree. In fact, a tree is a special type of graph with some restrictions. *Graphs* are data structures that have a wide-ranging application in real life. These include analysis of electrical circuits, **finding the shortest routes between two places,** **course/task scheduling,** building navigation systems like GPS, even social media using graphs to store data about each user, etc.
