There are 2 approaches to traversing a graph and that is `breadth-first search` and `depth-search first`. Both serves different purposes as we will find later in questions.
Also note that the traversal performed in these cases will only work for connected-undirected graphs.

- [[BFS Traversal]]
- [[DFS Traversal]]
- [[Find if Path Exists between 2 Nodes]]
- [[Connected Components in Graph]]

Return -> [[Graphs]]
