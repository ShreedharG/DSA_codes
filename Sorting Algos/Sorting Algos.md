It is an important concept in coding journey which allows us to see data analytically, solve numerous problems and use it for making complex operations easier. For example, used in Dijkstra's Algo where paths are sorted from minimal to maximal.

**There are 5 basic types of sorting methods we learn: 3 are N^2 time complex while the other two have average N.log(N) time complexity.**
### N-square time complexity approach

- [[Bubblesort]]
- [[Insertion sort]]
- [[Selection sort]]

### Nlog(N) time complexity approach

- [[Mergesort]]
- [[Quicksort]]
